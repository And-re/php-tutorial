      	<h2>Back to school</h2>
	<p>When you first started reading this series, I promised you that
	you’d have a whole lot of fun. If you’re the cynical type, you may be
	feeling that I didn’t keep my promise. After all, how much fun have you
	really had so far? All you’ve done is learn a bunch of
	theoretical rules, added and subtracted numbers from each other, learnt
	primitive decision-making and gone round and round in the circular
	funhouse of loops. Heck, if this wasn’t a PHP tutorial, it would be
	kindergarten…</p>
	<p>I hear you.</p>
	<p>In this segment of our ongoing saga, I’m going to teach you how to
	do something that’s definitely not for kids. It involves getting down
	and dirty with files on the disk: meeting them (shock!), reading their
	contents (shriek!) and (horror of horrors!) writing data to them. All
	of these exciting activities will take place under the aegis of PHP’s
	very cool file manipulation API, which allows you to view and modify
	file attributes, read and list directory contents, alter file
	permissions, retrieve file contents into a variety of native data
	structures, and search for files based on specific patterns.</p>
	<p>Let’s get started!</p>

	<h2>Handle with care</h2>
	<p>I’ll begin with something simple: opening a file and reading its
	contents. Let’s assume that somewhere on your disk, hidden under
	/usr/local/stuff/that/should/be/elsewhere/recipes/, you have a text
	file containing the recipe for the perfect Spanish omelette. You now wish
	to read the contents of this file into a PHP script.</p>
	<p>In order to do this, there are three distinct steps to be
	followed:
	<ul>
		<li>Open the file and assign it a file handle.</li>
		<li>Interact with the file, via its handle, and extract its contents
		into a PHP variable.</li>
		<li>Close the file.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>Here’s a PHP script that does just that:</p>
	{% highlight php %}<?php
// set file to read
$file = '/usr/local/stuff/that/should/be/elsewhere/recipes/omelette.txt' or die('Could not open file!');
// open file
$fh = fopen($file, 'r') or die('Could not open file!');
// read file contents
$data = fread($fh, filesize($file)) or die('Could not read file!');
// close file
fclose($fh);
// print file contents
echo $data;
?>{% endhighlight %}
	<p>Run this script through your Web browser, and PHP should return the
	contents of the file.</p>
	<p>Now let me explain each of the three steps above in detail:</p>

	<h2>Open the file and assign it a file handle</h2>
	<p>PHP needs a file handle to read data from a file. This file handle
	can be created with the fopen() function, which accepts two arguments:
	the name and path to the file, and a string indicating the “mode” in
	which the file is to be opened ('r' for read).</p>
	<p>Three different modes are available for use with the fopen()
	function. Here’s the list:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>'r' – opens a file in read mode</li>
		<li>'w' – opens a file in write mode, destroying existing file
		contents</li>
		<li>'a' – opens a file in append mode, preserving existing file
		contents</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Interaction with the file</h2>
	<p>If the fopen() function is successful, it returns a file handle,
	$fh, which can be used for further interaction with the file. This file
	handle is used by the fread() function, which reads the file and places
	its contents into a variable.</p>
	<p>The second argument to fread() is the number of bytes to be read.
	You can usually obtain this information through the filesize() function, which – who’d have guessed it?!- returns the size of the
	file in bytes.</p>

	<h2>Close the file</h2>
	<p>This last step is not strictly necessary as PHP closes the file
	automatically once it reaches the end of the script, but it’s a good
	habit to develop. Explicitly closing the file with fclose() has two
	advantages: it ties up loose ends in your script, and it wins you lots
	of good karma from the PHP community.</p>
	<p>You probably haven’t see the die() function before, either. This
	function is mostly used as a primitive error-handling mechanism. In the
	event of a fatal error, such as the file path being invalid or the file
	permissions being such that PHP cannot read it, die() terminates script
	processing and optionally displays a user-specified error message
	indicating why it committed suicide.</p>

	<h2>Different strokes</h2>
	<p>An alternative method of reading data from a file is the very cool
	file() function, which reads the entire file into an array (remember
	them?) with one line of code. Each element of the array then contains
	one line from the file. To display the contents of the file, simply
	iterate over the array in a foreach() loop and print each element.</p>
	<p>The following example demonstrates:</p>
	{% highlight php %}<?php
// set file to read
$file = '/usr/local/stuff/that/should/be/elsewhere/recipes/omelette.txt' or die('Could not read file!');
// read file into array
$data = file($file) or die('Could not read file!');
// loop through array and print each line
foreach ($data as $line) {
	echo $line;
}
?>{% endhighlight %}
	<p>In this example, the file() command opens the file, reads it into an
	array and closes the file – all in one, single, elegant movement. Each
	element of the array now corresponds to a line from the file. It’s easy
	to print the file’s contents now – just reach for that mainstay of
	array processing, the foreach() loop.</p>
	<p>Don’t want the data in an array? Try the file_get_contents()
	function, new in PHP 4.3.0 and PHP 5.0, which reads the entire file
	into a string:</p>
	{% highlight php %}<?php
// set file to read
$file = '/usr/local/stuff/that/should/be/elsewhere/recipes/omelette.txt';
// read file into string
$data = file_get_contents($file) or die('Could not read file!');
// print contents
echo $data;
?>{% endhighlight %}
	<p>Who am I kidding? I always use the one-line functions noted above
	instead of the three-line sequence of fopen(), fread() and fclose().
	Laziness conquers all.</p>

	<h2>When laziness is a virtue</h2>
	<p>PHP also offers two very useful functions to import files into a PHP
	script: the include() and require()functions. These functions can be
	used to suck external files lock, stock and barrel into a PHP script,
	which is very handy if, for example, you have a modular application
	which has its code broken down across files in separate locations.</p>
	<p>The best way to understand the utility of the include() and
	require() functions is with an example. Assume that on your Web site
	you have a standard menu bar at the top of every page, and a standard
	copyright notice in the bottom. Instead of copying and pasting the
	header and footer code on each individual page, PHP gurus simply create
	separate files for the header and footer, and import them at the top
	and bottom of each script. This also makes a change to the site design
	easier to implement: instead of manually editing a gazillion files, you
	simply edit two, and the changes are reflected across your entire site
	instantaneously.</p>
	<p>Let’s see a real live example of this in action. Create the header
	in one file, called header.php:</p>
	{% highlight php %}<html>
<head><title><?php echo $page['title'];?></title></head>
<body>
<!-- top menu bar -->
<table width="90%" border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5">
<tr>
<td><a href="#">Home</a></td>
<td><a href="#">Site Map</a></td>
<td><a href="#">Search</a></td>
<td><a href="#">Help</a></td>
</tr>
</table>
<!-- header ends -->{% endhighlight %}
	<p>Next, create the footer with the copyright notice in a second file,
	footer.php:</p>
	{% highlight php %}<!-- footer begins -->
<br>
<center>Your usage of this site is subject to its published <a href="tac.html">terms and conditions</a>. Data is copyright Big Company Inc, 1995-<?php echo date("Y", mktime()); ?></center>
</body>
</html>{% endhighlight %}
	<p>Finally, create a script to display the main content of your site,
	and include() the header and footer at appropriate places:</p>
	{% highlight php %}<?php
// create an array to set page-level variables
$page = array();
$page['title'] = 'Product Catalog';
/* once the file is imported, the variables set above will become available to it */
// include the page header
include('header.php');
?>
<!-- HTML content here -->
<?php
// include the page footer
include('footer.php');
?>{% endhighlight %}
	<p>Now, when you run the script above, PHP will automatically read in
	the header and footer files, merge them with the HTML content, and
	display the complete page to you. Simple, isn’t it?</p>
	<p>Notice that you can even write PHP code inside the files being
	imported. When the file is first read in, the parser will look for
	&lt;?php...?&gt; tags, and automatically execute the code inside it.
	(If you’re familiar with JavaScript, you can use this feature to
	replicate functionality similar to that of the onLoad() page event
	handler in JavaScript.)</p>
	<p>PHP also offers the require_once() and include_once()functions,
	which ensure that a file which has already been read is not read again.
	This can come in handy if you have a situation in which you want to
	eliminate multiple reads of the same include file, either for
	performance reasons or to avoid corruption of the variable space.</p>
	<p>A quick note on the difference between the include() and
	require()functions: the require()function returns a fatal error if the
	named file cannot be found and halts script processing, while the
	include() function returns a warning but allows script processing to
	continue.</p>

	<h2>Writing to ma</h2>
	<p>After everything you’ve just read, you’ve probably realized that
	reading a file is not exactly brain surgery. So let’s proceed to
	something slightly more difficult – writing to a file.</p>
	<p>The steps involved in writing data to a file are almost identical to
	those involved in reading it: open the file and obtain a file handle,
	use the file handle to write data to it, and close the file. There are
	two differences: first, you must fopen() the file in write mode ('w'
	for write), and second, instead of using the fread() function to read
	from the file handle, use the fwrite() function to write to it. Take a
	look:</p>
	{% highlight php %}<?php
// set file to write
$file = '/tmp/dump.txt';
// open file
$fh = fopen($file, 'w') or die('Could not open file!');
// write to file
fwrite($fh, "Look, Ma, I wrote a file!") or die('Could not write to file');
// close file
fclose($fh);
?>{% endhighlight %}
	<p>When you run this script, it should create a file named dump.txt in
	/tmp, and write a line of text to it, with a carriage return at the
	end. Notice that double quotes are needed to convert
	into a carriage return.</p>
	<p>The fopen(), fwrite() and fread() functions are all binary-safe,
	which means you can use them on binary files without worrying about
	damage to the file contents. Read more about many of the issues related
	to binary-safe file manipulation on different platforms at
	<a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.fopen.php">http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.fopen.php</a>.</p>
	<p>If I’ve spoiled you by showing you the one-line shortcut functions
	for file reads, let me damage you further by introducing you to the
	file_put_contents() function, new in PHP 5.0, which takes a string and
	writes it to a file in a single line of code.</p>
	{% highlight php %}<?php
// set file to write
$filename = '/tmp/dump.txt';
// write to file
file_put_contents($filename, "Look, Ma, I wrote a file!") or die('Could not write to file');
?>{% endhighlight %}
	<p>Bear in mind that the directory in which you’re trying to create the
	file must exist before you can write to it. Forgetting this important
	step is a common cause of script errors.</p>

	<h2>Information is power</h2>
	<p>PHP also comes with a bunch of functions that allow you to test the
	status of a file – for example to find out whether it exists, whether
	it’s empty, whether it’s readable or writable, and whether it’s a
	binary or text file. Of these, the most commonly used operator is the
	file_exists() function, which is used to test for the existence of a
	specific file.</p>
	<p>Here’s an example which asks the user to enter the path to a file in
	a Web form, and then returns a message displaying whether or not the
	file exists:</p>
	{% highlight php %}<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<?php
// if form has not yet been submitted
// display input box
if (!isset($_POST['file'])) {
?>
	<form action="<?php echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']; ?>" method="post">
		Enter file path <input type="text" name="file">
	</form>
<?php
} else {
	// Else process form input
	// check if file exists
	// display appropriate message
	if (file_exists($_POST['file'])) {
		echo 'File exists!';
	} else {
		echo 'File does not exist!';
	}
}
?>
</body>
</html>{% endhighlight %}
	<p>There are many more such functions. Here’s a brief list, followed by
	an example that builds on the previous one to provide more information
	on the file specified by the user.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>is_dir() – returns a Boolean indicating whether the specified path
		is a directory</li>
		<li>is_file() – returns a Boolean indicating whether the specified file
		is a regular file</li>
		<li>is_link() – returns a Boolean indicating whether the specified file
		is a symbolic link</li>
		<li>is_executable() – returns a Boolean indicating whether the
		specified file is executable</li>
		<li>is_readable()- returns a Boolean indicating whether the specified
		file is readable</li>
		<li>is_writable()- returns a Boolean indicating whether the specified
		file is writable</li>
		<li>filesize() – gets size of file</li>
		<li>filemtime() – gets last modification time of file</li>
		<li>filamtime() – gets last access time of file</li>
		<li>fileowner() – gets file owner</li>
		<li>filegroup() – gets file group</li>
		<li>fileperms() – gets file permissions</li>
		<li>filetype() – gets file type</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This script asks for a file name as input and uses the functions
	above to return information on it.</p>
	{% highlight php %}<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<?php
/* if form has not yet been submitted, display input box */
if (!isset($_POST['file'])) {
?>
	<form action="<?php echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']; ?>" method="post">
		Enter file path <input type="text" name="file">
	</form>
<?php
} else {
	echo 'File name: <b>'.$_POST['file']  .'</b><br />';
	/* check if file exists and display appropriate message */
	if (file_exists($_POST['file'])) {
		// print file size
		echo 'File size: '.filesize($_POST['file']).' bytes<br />';
		// print file owner
		echo 'File owner: '.fileowner($_POST['file']).'<br />';
		// print file group
		echo 'File group: '.filegroup($_POST['file']).'<br />';
		// print file permissions
		echo 'File permissions: '.fileperms($_POST['file']).'<br />';
		// print file type
		echo 'File type: '.filetype($_POST['file']).'<br />';
		// print file last access time
		echo 'File last accessed on: '.date('Y-m-d', fileatime($_POST['file'])).'<br />';
		// print file last modification time
		echo 'File last modified on: '.date('Y-m-d', filemtime($_POST['file'])).'<br />';
		// is it a directory?
		if (is_dir($_POST['file'])) {
			echo 'File is a directory <br />';
		}
		// is it a file?
		if (is_file($_POST['file'])) {
			echo 'File is a regular file <br />';
		}
		// is it a link?
		if (is_link($_POST['file'])) {
			echo 'File is a symbolic link <br />';
		}
		// is it executable?
		if (is_executable($_POST['file'])) {
			echo 'File is executable <br />';
		}
		// is it readable?
		if (is_readable($_POST['file'])) {
			echo 'File is readable <br />';
		}
		// is it writable?
		if (is_writable($_POST['file'])) {
			echo 'File is writable <br />';
		}
	} else {
		echo 'File does not exist! <br />';
	}
}
?>
</body>
</html>{% endhighlight %}

	<h2>Breaking eggs</h2>
	<p>So now you know how to read a file, write to it, and test its
	status. Let’s look at some examples of what you can do with this
	new-found power.</p>
	<p>Let’s go back to my Spanish omelette recipe. Let’s suppose I’m feeling
	generous, and I decide that I’d like to hear what people really think about my culinary skills. Since I have a bunch of recipes that
	I’d like to share with people, and since they all look something like
	this:</p>
	<pre>
SPANISH OMELETTE
INGREDIENTS:
- 1 chopped onion
- 1 chopped tomato
- 1/2 chopped green pepper
- 4 beaten eggs
- Salt and pepper to taste
METHOD:
1. Fry onions in a pan
2. Pour beaten eggs over onions and fry gently
3. Add tomatoes, green pepper, salt and pepper to taste
4. Serve with toast or bread
	</pre>
	<p>I need a quick way to convert them all into HTML so that they look
	presentable on my Web site. We’ve already established that I’m lazy, so
	fuggedaboutme re-creating the recipes in HTML. Instead, I’ll have PHP
	do the heavy lifting for me:</p>
	{% highlight php %}<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<?php
// read recipe file into arra
$data = file('/usr/local/stuff/that/should/be/elsewhere/omelette.txt') or die('Could not read file!');
/* first line contains title: read it into variable */
$title = $data[0];
// remove first line from array
array_shift($data);
?>
<h2><?php echo $title; ?></h2>
<?php
/* iterate over content and print it */
foreach ($data as $line) {
	echo nl2br($line);
}
?>
</body>
</html>{% endhighlight %}
	<p>I’ve used the file() function to read the recipe into an array, and
	assign the first line (the title) to a variable. That title is then
	printed at the top of the page. Since the rest of the data is fairly
	presentable as is, I can simply print the lines to the screen one after
	the other. Line breaks are automatically handled for me by the
	extremely cool nl2br() function, which converts regular text linebreaks
	into the HTML equivalent, the <br /> tag. The end result: an
	HTML-ized version of my recipe that the world can marvel at. Take a look:</p>
	<pre>
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;SPANISH OMELETTE
&lt;/h2&gt;
INGREDIENTS:&lt;br /&gt;
- 1 chopped onion&lt;br /&gt;
- 1 chopped tomato&lt;br /&gt;
- 1/2 chopped green pepper&lt;br /&gt;
- 4 beaten eggs&lt;br /&gt;

- Salt and pepper to taste&lt;br /&gt;
METHOD:&lt;br /&gt;
1. Fry onions in a pan&lt;br /&gt;
2. Pour beaten eggs over onions and fry gently&lt;br /&gt;
3. Add tomatoes, green pepper, salt and pepper to taste&lt;br /&gt;
4. Serve with toast or bread&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
	<p>If the elegance and creative simplicity of my Spanish omelette recipe
	has left you speechless, I’m not surprised – many people feel that
	way. Until you get your voice back: Ciao… and make sure you come back
	to work through <a href="part6.html">Part Six of PHP 101</a>, which discusses creating your own reusable functions.</p>

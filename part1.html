      	<h2>The only acronym you'll ever need</h2>
      	<p>If you're new to Web development, you could be forgiven for thinking that it consists of no more than a mass of acronyms, each one more indecipherable thanthe last. ASP, CGI, SOAP, XML, HTTP - the list seems never-ending, and
	the sheer volume of information on each of these can discourage the most avid programmer. But before you put on your running shoes and flee, there's a little secret you should know. To put together a cutting-edge Web site, chock full of all the latest bells and whistles, there's only one acronym you really need to know:</p>
	<p>PHP</p>
	<p>Now, while you have almost certainly heard of PHP, you may not be aware of just how powerful the language is, and how much it can do for you. Today, PHP has the enviable position of being the only open-source server-side scripting language that's both fun and easy to learn. This is not just advertising: recent surveys show that more than 16,000,000 Web sites use PHP as a server side scripting language, and the language also tops the list of most popular Apache modules.</p>
	<p>Why, you ask? The short answer: it’s powerful, it’s easy to use, and
	it’s free. Extremely robust and scalable, PHP can be used for the most
	demanding of applications, and delivers excellent performance even at
	high loads. Built-in database support means that you can begin creating
	data-driven applications immediately, XML support makes it suitable for
	the new generation of XML-enabled applications, and the extensible architecture
	makes it easy for developers to use it as a framework to build their own
	custom modules. Toss in a great manual, a knowledgeable developer community
	and a really low price (can you spell f-r-e-e?) and you’ve got the makings
	of a winner!</p>
	<p>My goal in this series of tutorials is very simple: I’ll be
	teaching you the basics of using PHP, and showing you why I think it’s
	the best possible tool for Web application development today.
	I’ll be making no assumptions about your level of knowledge,
	other than that you can understand basic HTML and have a sense of
	humor. And before you ask… Yes, this series covers both PHP 4 and
	PHP 5, with new PHP 5 features flagged for easy reference.</p>
	<p>Let's get going!</p>

	<h2>The right enviroment</h2>
	<p>PHP is typically used in combination with a Web server like Apache.
	Requests for PHP scripts are received by the Web server, and are handled
	by the PHP interpreter. The results obtained after execution are returned
	to the Web server, which takes care of transmitting them to the client
	browser. Within the PHP script itself, the sky’s the limit – your
	script can perform calculations, process user input, interact with a
	database, read and write files… Basically, anything you can do with a
	regular programming language, you can do inside your PHP scripts.</p>
	<p>From the above, it is clear that in order to begin using PHP, you
	need to have a proper development environment set up.</p>
	<p>This series will focus on using PHP with the Apache Web server on
	Linux, but you can just as easily use PHP with Apache on Windows, UNIX
	and Mac OS. Detailed instructions on how to set up this development
	environment on each platform are available in the online manual, at
	<a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/installation.php">http://www.php.net/manual/en/installation.php</a> - or you can just download a copy of PHP 5 from
	<a href="http://www.php.net">http://www.php.net</a> and read the installation instructions.</p>
	<p>Go do that now, and come back when you’ve successfully installed and tested PHP.</p>

	<h2>Start me up</h2>
	<p>There’s one essential concept that you need to get your mind around
	before we proceed further. Unlike CGI scripts, which require you to
	write code to output HTML, PHP lets you embed PHP code in regular HTML
	pages, and execute the embedded PHP code when the page is requested.</p>
	<p>These embedded PHP commands are enclosed within special start and
	end tags, like this:</p>
	{% highlight php %}
		<?php echo "lol"; ?>
	{% endhighlight %}
	<p>Here's a simple example that demonstrates how PHP and HTML can be combined</p>

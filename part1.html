      	<h2>The only acronym you'll ever need</h2>
      	<p>If you're new to Web development, you could be forgiven for thinking that it consists of no more than a mass of acronyms, each one more indecipherable thanthe last. ASP, CGI, SOAP, XML, HTTP - the list seems never-ending, and
	the sheer volume of information on each of these can discourage the most avid programmer. But before you put on your running shoes and flee, there's a little secret you should know. To put together a cutting-edge Web site, chock full of all the latest bells and whistles, there's only one acronym you really need to know:</p>
	<p>PHP</p>
	<p>Now, while you have almost certainly heard of PHP, you may not be aware of just how powerful the language is, and how much it can do for you. Today, PHP has the enviable position of being the only open-source server-side scripting language that's both fun and easy to learn. This is not just advertising: recent surveys show that more than 16,000,000 Web sites use PHP as a server side scripting language, and the language also tops the list of most popular Apache modules.</p>
	<p>Why, you ask? The short answer: it’s powerful, it’s easy to use, and
	it’s free. Extremely robust and scalable, PHP can be used for the most
	demanding of applications, and delivers excellent performance even at
	high loads. Built-in database support means that you can begin creating
	data-driven applications immediately, XML support makes it suitable for
	the new generation of XML-enabled applications, and the extensible architecture
	makes it easy for developers to use it as a framework to build their own
	custom modules. Toss in a great manual, a knowledgeable developer community
	and a really low price (can you spell f-r-e-e?) and you’ve got the makings
	of a winner!</p>
	<p>My goal in this series of tutorials is very simple: I’ll be
	teaching you the basics of using PHP, and showing you why I think it’s
	the best possible tool for Web application development today.
	I’ll be making no assumptions about your level of knowledge,
	other than that you can understand basic HTML and have a sense of
	humor. And before you ask… Yes, this series covers both PHP 4 and
	PHP 5, with new PHP 5 features flagged for easy reference.</p>
	<p>Let's get going!</p>

	<h2>The right enviroment</h2>
	<p>PHP is typically used in combination with a Web server like Apache.
	Requests for PHP scripts are received by the Web server, and are handled
	by the PHP interpreter. The results obtained after execution are returned
	to the Web server, which takes care of transmitting them to the client
	browser. Within the PHP script itself, the sky’s the limit – your
	script can perform calculations, process user input, interact with a
	database, read and write files… Basically, anything you can do with a
	regular programming language, you can do inside your PHP scripts.</p>
	<p>From the above, it is clear that in order to begin using PHP, you
	need to have a proper development environment set up.</p>
	<p>This series will focus on using PHP with the Apache Web server on
	Linux, but you can just as easily use PHP with Apache on Windows, UNIX
	and Mac OS. Detailed instructions on how to set up this development
	environment on each platform are available in the online manual, at
	<a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/installation.php">http://www.php.net/manual/en/installation.php</a> - or you can just download a copy of PHP 5 from
	<a href="http://www.php.net">http://www.php.net</a> and read the installation instructions.</p>
	<p>Go do that now, and come back when you’ve successfully installed and tested PHP.</p>

	<h2>Start me up</h2>
	<p>There’s one essential concept that you need to get your mind around
	before we proceed further. Unlike CGI scripts, which require you to
	write code to output HTML, PHP lets you embed PHP code in regular HTML
	pages, and execute the embedded PHP code when the page is requested.</p>
	<p>These embedded PHP commands are enclosed within special start and
	end tags, like this:</p>
	{% highlight php %}<?php echo "lol"; ?>{% endhighlight %}
	<p>Here's a simple example that demonstrates how PHP and HTML can be combined:</p>
	{% highlight php %}<html>
<head></head>
<body>
Agent: So who do you think you are, anyhow?
<br>
<?php
// Print output
echo 'Neo: I am Neo, but my people call me The One.';
?>
</body>
</html>{% endhighlight %}
        <p>Not quite your traditional “Hello, World” program… but then
	again, I always thought tradition was over-rated.</p>
	<p>Save the above script to a location under your Web server document root, with a
	.php extension, and browse to it. You’ll see something like this:</p>
	<img src="images/part1-ex1.png" alt="The resultant HTML">
	<p>Look at the HTML source:</p>
	{% highlight html %}<html>
<head></head>
<body>
Agent: Who do you think you are, anyhow?
<br>
Neo: I am Neo, but my people call me The One.</body>
</html>{% endhighlight %}
	<p>What just happened? When you requested the script above, Apache intercepted
	your request and handed it off to PHP. PHP then parsed the script,
	executing the code between the <?php...?> marks and
	replacing it with the output of the code run. The result was then handed
	back to the server and transmitted to the client. Since the output contained
	valid HTML, the browser was able to render it for display to the user.</p>
	<p>A close look at the script will reveal the basic syntactical rules of PHP.
	Every PHP statement ends in a semi-colon. This convention is identical to
	that used in Perl, and omitting the semi-colon is one of the most common
	mistakes newbies make. That said, it is interesting to note that a semi-colon
	is not needed to terminate the last line of a PHP block. The
	PHP closing tag includes a semi-colon, therefore the following is perfectly
	valid PHP code:</p>
	{% highlight php %}<?php
// Print output
echo 'Neo: I am Neo, but my people call me The One.';
?>{% endhighlight %}
	<p>It’s also possible to add comments to your PHP code, as I’ve done in
	the example above. PHP supports both single-line and multi-line comment
	blocks:</p>
	{% highlight php %}<?php
// This is a single-line comment
/* This is a
multi-line
comment */
?>{% endhighlight %}
	<p>Blank lines within the PHP tags are ignored by the parser.
	Everything outside the tags is also ignored by the parser, and returned
	as-is. Only the code between the tags is read and executed.</p>

	<h2>A case of identity</h2>
	<p>Variables are the bread and butter of every programming language…
	and PHP has them too. A variable can be
	thought of as a programming construct used to store both numeric and
	non-numeric data; the contents of a variable can be altered during
	program execution. Finally, variables can be compared with each other,
	and you – the programmer – can write code that performs
	specific actions on the basis of this comparison.</p>
	<p>PHP supports a number of different variable types: integers, floating
	point numbers, strings and arrays. In many languages, it’s essential to
	specify the variable type before using it: for example, a variable may
	need to be specified as type integer or type array.
	Give PHP credit for a little intelligence, though: it automagically
	determines variable type by the context in which it is being used!</p>
	<p>Every variable has a name. In PHP, a variable name is preceded by a
	dollar ($) symbol and must begin with a letter or underscore, optionally
	followed by more letters, numbers and/or underscores. For example, $popeye, $one and $INCOME are all valid PHP variable names, while $123 and $48hrs are invalid.</p>
	<p>Note that variable names in PHP are case sensitive, so $me is
	different from $Me or $ME.</p>
	<p>Here’s a simple example that demonstrates PHP’s variables:</p>
	{% highlight php %}<html>
<head></head>
<body>
Agent: So who do you think you are, anyhow?
<br>
<?php
// Define variables
$name = 'Neo';
$rank = 'Anomaly';
$serialNumber = 1;
// Print output
echo "Neo: I am <b>$name</b>, the <b>$rank</b>. You can call me by my serial number, <b>$serialNumber</b>.";
?>
</body>
</html>{% endhighlight %}
	<p>Here, the variables $name, $rank and
	$serialNumber are first defined with string and numeric
	values, and then substituted in the echo() function call.
	The echo() function, along with the print() function,
	is commonly used to print data to the standard output device (here, the
	browser). Notice that I’ve included HTML tags within the call to echo(),
	and those have been rendered by the browser in its output. You can do this too. Really.</p>

	<h2>An equal music</h2>
	<p>To assign a value to a variable, you use the assignment
	operator: the = symbol. This is used to assign a value
	(the right side of the equation) to a variable (the left side). The
	value being assigned need not always be fixed; it could also be another
	variable, an expression, or even an expression involving other
	variables, as below:</p>
	{% highlight php %}<?php
$age = $dob + 15;
?>{% endhighlight %}
	<p>Interestingly, you can also perform more than one assignment at a
	time. Consider the following example, which assigns three variables the
	same value simultaneously:</p>
	{% highlight php %}<?php
$angle1 = $angle2 = $angle3 = 60;
?>{% endhighlight %}
	
	<h2>Not my type</h2>
	<p>Every language has different types of variable – and PHP is no
	exception. The language supports a wide variety of data types,
	including simple numeric, character, string and Boolean types, and more
	complex arrays and objects. Here’s a quick list of the basic ones, with
	examples:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Boolean</strong>: The simplest variable type in PHP, a Boolean
		variable, simply specifies a true or false value.
		{% highlight php %}<?php
$sexy = true;
?>{% endhighlight %}</li>
		<li><strong>Integer</strong>: An integer is a plain-vanilla whole number like 75, -95, 2000 or 1.
		{% highlight php %}<?php
$age = 21;
?>{% endhighlight %}</li>
		<li><strong>Floating-point</strong>: A floating-point number is typically a fractional
		number such as 12.5 or 3.141592653589. Floating point numbers may be
		specified using either decimal or scientific notation.
		{% highlight php %}<?php
$temperature = 21.5;
?>{% endhighlight %}</li>
		<li><strong>String</strong>: A string is a sequence of characters, like “hello” or
		“abracadabra”. String values may be enclosed in either double quotes
		(“”) or single quotes(”). (Quotation marks within the string itself can
		be “escaped” with a backslash (\) character.) String values enclosed in
		double quotes are automatically parsed for special characters and variable
		names; if these are found, they are replaced with the appropriate value.
		Here’s an example:
		{% highlight php %}<?php
$identity = 'James Bond';
$car = 'BMW';
// This would contain the string "James Bond drives a BMW"
$sentence = "$identity drives a $car";
echo $sentence;
?>{% endhighlight %}</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Market value</h2>
	<p>If variables are the building blocks of a programming language,
	operators are the glue that let you build something useful with
	them. You’ve already seen one example of an operator – the
	assignment operator -, which lets you assign a value to a
	variable. Since PHP believes in spoiling you, it also comes with
	operators for arithmetic, string, comparison and logical operations.</p>
	<p>A good way to get familiar with operators is to use them to perform
	arithmetic operations on variables, as in the following example:</p>
	{% highlight php %}<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<?php
// Set quantity
$quantity = 1000;
// Set original and current unit price
$origPrice = 100;
$currPrice = 25;
// Calculate the difference in price
$diffPrice = $currPrice - $origPrice;
// Calculate percentage change in price
$diffPricePercent = (($currPrice - $origPrice) * 100)/$origPrice
?>
Quantity: <?php echo $quantity; ?><br>
Cost Price: <?php echo $origPrice; ?><br>
Current Price: <?php echo $currPrice; ?><br>
Absolute change in price: <?php echo $diffPrice; ?><br>
Percent change in price: <?php echo $diffPricePercent; ?><br>
</body>
</html>{% endhighlight %}
	<p>Looks complex? Don’t be afraid – it’s actually pretty simple. The
	meat of the script is at the top, where I’ve set up variables for the
	unit cost and the quantity. Next, I’ve performed a bunch of calculations
	using PHP’s various mathematical operators, and stored the results of
	those calculations in different variables. The rest of the script is
	related to the display of the resulting calculations in a neat table.</p>
	<p>If you’d like, you can even perform an arithmetic operation
	simultaneously with an assignment, by using the two operators together.
	The two code snippets below are equivalent:</p>
	{% highlight php %}<?php
// This...
$a = 5;
$a = $a + 10;
// ... is this same as this
$a = 5;
$a += 10;
?>{% endhighlight %}
	<p>If you don’t believe me, try echoing them both.</p>

	<h2>Stringing things along</h2>
	<p>Why stop with numbers? PHP also allows you to add strings with the string
	concatenation operator, represented by a period (.). Take a look:</p>
	{% highlight php %}<?php
// Set up some variables
$a = 'the';
$b = 'games';
$c = 'begin';
$d = 'now';
// Combine them using the concatination operator
// This returns 'the games begin now<br>'
$statement = $a.' '.$b.' '.$c.' '.$d.'<br>';
print $statement;
// This returns 'the games begin now!'
$command = $c.' '.$a.' '.$b.' '.$d.'!';
print $command;
?>{% endhighlight %}
	<p>As before, you can concatenate and assign simultaneously, as
	below:</p>
	{% highlight php %}<?php
// Define string
$str = 'the';
// add and assign
$str .= 'n';
// $str now contains "then"
echo $str;
?>{% endhighlight %}

	<p>That’s about it for this tutorial. You now know all about the basic
	building blocks and glue of PHP – its variables and operators. In
	<a href="part2.html">Part Two</a> of this series, I’ll be using these
	fundamental concepts to demonstrate PHP’s powerful form processing capabilities.</p>
